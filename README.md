# Mailtuned

Mailtuned is a web application made for busy email marketers out there who don't have time to set up DNS settings on many domains. This will help you add SPF, DKIM, DMARC, tracking, and redirect records automatically for all your domains via one click!

# What is it built on?

This is a fullstack application made in Next JS (app router) where components are either self-made or restyled from shadcn/ui. Stylings are done in Tailwind. Application state are managed by Jotai and Tanstack Query. Forms use react-hook-form to minimize rerenders and speed up development process.

# How to run locally?

Clone the app, and then run `npm i` followed with `npm run dev`.
